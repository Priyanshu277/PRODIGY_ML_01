This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. Two regression algorithms are implemented and compared: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The dataset used includes various features that influence house prices, such as the size of the house (in square feet), number of rooms, location, and more. These features serve as the inputs for the models, while the target variable is the price of the house.

The project is structured in a single Jupyter Notebook, where both data preprocessing and model training are carried out. The notebook walks through the steps of cleaning and preparing the data, exploring the dataset, and building the predictive models. Linear Regression is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, while Random Forest Regressor is selected for its ability to handle complex data relationships and interactions.

After training, the models' performances are evaluated based on accuracy and other relevant metrics. The notebook provides a detailed comparison of the models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithm in predicting house prices, offering insights into which model may be more suitable depending on the specific use case.
